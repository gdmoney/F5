Slow Ramp Time (pool)
==============
 - specifies the duration during which the system sends less traffic to a newly-enabled pool member
 - the amount of traffic is based on the ratio of how long the pool member has been available compared to the slow ramp time, in seconds
 - once the pool member has been online for a time greater than the slow ramp time, the pool member receives a full proportion of the incoming traffic
 - slow ramp time is particularly useful for the least connections load balancing mode



Action on Service Down (pool)
======================
 - specifies how the system should respond when the target pool member becomes unavailable
 - the default is None, meaning that the system takes no action to manage existing connections when a pool member becomes unavailable



Manual Resume (monitor)
=============
 - displays whether the system automatically changes the status of a resource to Enabled at the next successful monitor check
 - Iif you set this option to Yes, you must manually re-enable the resource before the system can use it for load balancing connections
